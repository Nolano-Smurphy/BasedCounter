Based Counter:
The purpose of this project was to keep an active count of how many times the word "based" was used in a given Discord server. Ended up getting deprecated when Discord changed the way people interact with bots. Hasn't been updated since 2021.

Some values that are sensative to the ability of this to run were hard coded into the source file. I've removed those because I don't want those to be publically available.
